Plans

A plan describes the steps necessary to transform source code to the desired product. This can be from a simple call to "rake", to very complex build scripts. Plans can be "chained":plan/chain and organized as "child plans":plan/child. Plans are organized in "projects":project.

To create a plan, go to its project and click "New plan".

Plans in TinyCI consist of a name, a repository URL and build steps. The build steps are specified in a special Ruby DSL.

- @env environment@ := Set environment variables for this build as specified in the @environment@ hash.
- @rake [commands], environment@ := Run rake with the specified @commands@ and the @environment@. Both the commands array and the environment are optional.
- @sh command, [parameters]@ := Run shell command @command@ with @parameters@.
