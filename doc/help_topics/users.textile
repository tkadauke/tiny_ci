Users and Authentication / Authorization

It is possible to run TinyCI in two different operation modes:

# Without any user at all. Then any visitor has all rights necessary to fully operate TinyCI.
# With users. Then only administrators can add / edit projects and plans as well as configure TinyCI.

To enable users, simply create an account. With the first account, the "no user operation mode" is automatically disabled. The first account is automatically an administrator account.
